Latest changes
==============

3.2.0 (2011/07/31)
------------------

Enhanced REST API by exposing more functionalities (agent upgrade, deployments, plans). Note that the REST call ``HEAD /plan/<planId>/execution/<executionId>`` now returns a header called ``X-glu-completion`` (the old one ``X-LinkedIn-GLU-completion`` is still returned for backward compatibility).

* Implemented `glu-66 <https://github.com/linkedin/glu/issues/66>`_: `implement rest call GET /plans`
* Fixed `glu-81 <https://github.com/linkedin/glu/issues/81>`_: `Sometimes ste.message is null. It is null when the exception is java.util`
* Fixed `glu-82 <https://github.com/linkedin/glu/issues/82>`_: `Add some spacing around the pagination items.`
* Fixed `glu-83 <https://github.com/linkedin/glu/issues/83>`_: `NPE at http://glu/console/plan/deployments/XXX`

3.1.0 (2011/07/26)
------------------

Added unit test framework for glu script and created sibling project `glu-script-contribs <https://github.com/linkedin/glu-scripts-contrib>`_

* Implemented `glu-80 <https://github.com/linkedin/glu/issues/80>`_: `Add ability to write unit tests for glu script`
* Added ``Shell.httpPost`` method

3.0.0 (2011/06/25)
------------------

What is new in 3.0.0 ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.0.0 adds the following features:

* :ref:`parent/child relationship <static-model-entries-parent>` which adds the capability of decoupling the lifecycle of a parent and a child 
  (typical examples being deploying a webapp inside a webapp container or deploying a bundle in an OSGi container)
* define the desired state of an entry in the model (:ref:`entryState <static-model-entries-entryState>`) which, for example, allows you to deploy an 
  application without starting it
* The console is no longer precomputing the various plans (deploy, bounce, undeploy and redeploy) and they are now computed on demand only
* The delta is now a first class citizen and a new rest API allows to :ref:`access it <goe-rest-api-get-model-delta>`
* The core of the orchestration engine (delta, planner and deployer) has been fully rewritten to offer those new capabilities (now in java
  which should provide some performance improvements over groovy).
